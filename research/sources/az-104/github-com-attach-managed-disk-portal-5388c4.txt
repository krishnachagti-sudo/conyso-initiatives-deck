# Attach a managed data disk to a Windows VM by using the Azure portal

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets 

This article shows you how to attach a new managed data disk to a Windows virtual machine (VM) by using the Azure portal. 

## Add a data disk

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Virtual machines**.

1. Select a virtual machine from the list.

1. On the **Virtual machine** pane, select **Disks**.

1. On the **Disks** pane, select **Create and attach a new disk**.

1. In the drop-downs for the new disk, make the selections you want, and name the disk.

1. Select **Save** to create and attach the new data disk to the VM.

## Initialize a new data disk

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Initialize and format only a newly created, empty data disk. If the disk was previously used or contains existing data, initializing, repartitioning, or formatting it might make the data inaccessible or permanently erase it. Before proceeding, verify the disk number, size, and LUN to ensure that you selected the correct disk.
>
> After formatting is complete, confirm that the disk appears as **Online** and **Healthy** in **Disk Management** and that it has an assigned drive letter.

Follow these steps:

1. Connect to the VM.

1. Select the Windows **Start** menu inside the running VM and enter **diskmgmt.msc** in the search box. The **Disk Management** console opens.

1. Disk Management recognizes that you have a new, uninitialized disk and the **Initialize Disk** window appears.

1. Verify the new disk is selected and then select **OK** to initialize it.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If your disk is two tebibytes (TiB) or larger, you must use GPT partitioning. If it's under two TiB, you can use either MBR or GPT.

1. The new disk appears as **unallocated**. Right-click anywhere on the disk and select **New simple volume**. The **New Simple Volume Wizard** window opens.

1. Proceed through the wizard, keeping all of the defaults, and when you're done select **Finish**.

1. Close **Disk Management**.

1. A pop-up window appears notifying you that you need to format the new disk before you can use it. Select **Format disk**.

1. In the **Format new disk** window, check the settings, and then select **Start**.

1. A warning appears notifying you that formatting the disks erases all of the data. Select **OK**.

1. When the formatting is complete, select **OK**.
