# Consolidating billing for AWS Organizations
<a name="consolidated-billing"></a>

You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate billing and payment for multiple AWS accounts. Every organization in AWS Organizations has a *management account* that pays the charges of all the *member accounts*. For more information about organizations, see the [AWS Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/).

Consolidated billing has the following benefits:
+ **One bill** – You get one bill for multiple accounts in the same SOR. If an organization has accounts from multiple SORs, you receive one bill per SOR.
+ **Easy tracking** – You can track the charges across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data.
+ **Combined usage** – You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization. This shares the volume pricing discounts, Reserved Instance discounts, and Savings Plans. This can result in a lower charge for your project, department, or company than with individual standalone accounts. For more information, see [Volume discounts](useconsolidatedbilling-effective.md#useconsolidatedbilling-discounts).
+ **No extra fee** – Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost. 

**Note**  
The member account bills are for informational purpose only. The management account might reallocate the additional volume discounts, Reserved Instance, or Savings Plans discounts that your account receives.

If you have access to the management account, you can see a combined view of the AWS charges that the member accounts incur. You also can get a cost report for each member account.

**Important**  
When a member account leaves an organization, the member account can no longer access Cost Explorer data that was generated when the account was in the organization. The data isn't deleted, and the management account in the organization can still access the data. If the member account rejoins the organization, the member account can access the data again.

You can use billing transfer to get centralized access to cost management data and individual consolidated bills from multiple AWS Organizations. For more information, see [Transfer billing management to external accounts](orgs_transfer_billing.md).
