# Refine permissions in AWS using last accessed information
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed"></a>

As an administrator, you might grant permissions to IAM resources (roles, users, user groups, or policies) beyond what they require. IAM provides last accessed information to help you identify unused permissions so that you can remove them. You can use last accessed information to refine your policies and allow access to only the services and actions that your IAM identities and policies use. This helps you to better adhere to the [best practice of least privilege.](best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege) You can view last accessed information for identities or policies that exist in IAM or AWS Organizations.

You can continuously monitor last accessed information with unused access analyzers. For more information, see [Findings for external and unused access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-findings.html).

## Last accessed information types for IAM
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-data-types"></a>

You can view two types of last accessed information for IAM identities: allowed AWS service information and allowed action information. The information includes the date and time when the attempt to access an AWS API was made. For actions, last accessed information reports service management actions. Management actions include creation, deletion, and modification actions. To learn more about how to view last accessed information for IAM, see [View last accessed information for IAM](access_policies_last-accessed-view-data.md).

For example scenarios for using last accessed information to make decisions about the permissions that you grant to your IAM identities, see [Example scenarios for using last accessed information](access_policies_last-accessed-example-scenarios.md).

To learn more about how the information for management actions is provided, see [Things to know about last accessed information](#access_policies_last-accessed-know).

## Last accessed information for AWS Organizations
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-orgs"></a>

If you sign in using management account credentials, you can view service last accessed information for an AWS Organizations entity or policy in your organization. AWS Organizations entities include the organization root, organizational units (OUs), or accounts. Last accessed information for AWS Organizations includes information about services that are allowed by a service control policy (SCP). The information indicates which principals (root user, IAM user, or role) in an organization or account last attempted to access the service and when. To learn more about the report and how to view last accessed information for AWS Organizations, see [View last accessed information for AWS Organizations](access_policies_last-accessed-view-data-orgs.md).

For example scenarios for using last accessed information to make decisions about the permissions that you grant to your AWS Organizations entities, see [Example scenarios for using last accessed information](access_policies_last-accessed-example-scenarios.md).

## Things to know about last accessed information
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-know"></a>

Before you use last accessed information from a report to change the permissions for an IAM identity or AWS Organizations entity, review the following details about the information.
+ **Tracking period** – Recent activity appears in the IAM console within four hours. The tracking period for service information is at least 400 days depending on when the service started tracking actions information. The tracking period for Amazon S3 actions information began on April, 12, 2020. The tracking period for Amazon EC2, IAM, and Lambda actions began on April 7, 2021. The tracking period for all other services began on May 23, 2023. For a list of services for which action last accessed information is available, see [IAM action last accessed information services and actions](access_policies_last-accessed-action-last-accessed.md). For more information on which Regions action last accessed information is available in, see [Where AWS tracks last accessed information](#last-accessed_tracking-period).
+ **Attempts reported** – The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an AWS API, not just the successful attempts. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.
+ **PassRole** – The `iam:PassRole` action is not tracked and is not included in IAM action last accessed information.
+ **Action last accessed information** – Action last accessed information is available for service management actions accessed by IAM identities. See the [list of services and their actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_last-accessed-action-last-accessed.html#access_policies_last-accessed-action-last-accessed-supported-actions) for which action last accessed reports information.
**Note**  
Action last accessed information is not available for any data plane event.
+ **Management events** – IAM provides action information for service management events that are logged by CloudTrail. Sometimes, CloudTrail management events are also called control plane operations or control plane events. Management events provide visibility into administrative operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. To learn more about management events in CloudTrail, see [Logging management events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*.
+ **Report owner** – Only the principal that generates a report can view the report details. This means that when you view the information in the AWS Management Console, you might have to wait for it to generate and load. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to get report details, your credentials must match the credentials of the principal that generated the report. If you use temporary credentials for a role or AWS STS federated user principal, you must generate and retrieve the report during the same session. For more information about assumed-role session principals, see [AWS JSON policy elements: Principal](reference_policies_elements_principal.md).
+ **IAM resources** – The last accessed information for IAM includes IAM resources (roles, users, IAM groups, and policies) in your account. Last accessed information for AWS Organizations includes principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or the AWS account root user) in the specified AWS Organizations entity. The last accessed information does not include unauthenticated attempts.
+ **IAM policy types** – The last accessed information for IAM includes services that are allowed by an IAM identity's policies. These are policies attached to a role or attached to a user directly or through a group. Access allowed by other policy types is not included in your report. The excluded policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations SCPs, IAM permissions boundaries, and session policies. Permissions that are provided by service-linked roles are defined by the service that they are linked to and can't be modified in IAM. To learn more about service-linked roles, see [Create a service-linked role](id_roles_create-service-linked-role.md) To learn how the different policy types are evaluated to allow or deny access, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md).
+ **AWS Organizations policy types** – The information for AWS Organizations includes only services that are allowed by an AWS Organizations entity's inherited service control policies (SCPs). SCPs are policies attached to a root, OU, or account. Access allowed by other policy types is not included in your report. The excluded policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and session policies. To learn how the different policy types are evaluated to allow or deny access, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md).
+ **Specifying a policy ID** – When you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to generate a report for last accessed information in AWS Organizations, you can optionally specify a policy ID. The resulting report includes information for the services that are allowed by only that policy. The information includes the most recent account activity in the specified AWS Organizations entity or the entity's children. For more information, see [aws iam generate-organizations-access-report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/generate-organizations-access-report.html) or [GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport.html).
+ **AWS Organizations management account** – You must sign in to your organization's management account to view service last accessed information. You can choose to view information for the management account using the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. The resulting report lists all AWS services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes information for only the management account. However, reports for other AWS Organizations entities do not return information for activity in the management account.
+ **AWS Organizations settings** – An administrator must [enable SCPs in your organization root](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies.html#enable_policies_on_root) before you can generate data for AWS Organizations.

## Permissions required
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-permissions"></a>

To view the last accessed information in the AWS Management Console, you must have a policy that grants the necessary permissions.

### Permissions for IAM information
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-permissions-iam"></a>

To use the IAM console to view the last accessed information for an IAM user, role, or policy, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
+ `iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`
+ `iam:Get*`
+ `iam:List*`

These permissions allow a user to see the following:
+ Which users, groups, or roles are attached to a [managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#managed_policy)
+ Which services a user or role can access
+ The last time they accessed the service
+ The last time they attempted to use a specific Amazon EC2, IAM, Lambda, or Amazon S3 action

To use the AWS CLI or AWS API to view last accessed information for IAM, you must have permissions that match the operation you want to use:
+ `iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`
+ `iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`
+ `iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities`
+ `iam:ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess`

This example shows how you might create an identity-based policy that allows viewing IAM last accessed information. Additionally, it allows read-only access to all of IAM. This policy defines permissions for programmatic and console access.

            "iam:List*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
}
```

### Permissions for AWS Organizations information
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-permissions-orgs"></a>

To use the IAM console to view a report for the root, OU, or account entities in AWS Organizations, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
+ `iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport`
+ `iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport`
+ `organizations:DescribeAccount`
+ `organizations:DescribeOrganization`
+ `organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit`
+ `organizations:DescribePolicy`
+ `organizations:ListChildren`
+ `organizations:ListParents`
+ `organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget`
+ `organizations:ListRoots`
+ `organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy`

To use the AWS CLI or AWS API to view service last accessed information for AWS Organizations, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
+ `iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport`
+ `iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport`
+ `organizations:DescribePolicy`
+ `organizations:ListChildren`
+ `organizations:ListParents`
+ `organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget`
+ `organizations:ListRoots`
+ `organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy`

This example shows how you might create an identity-based policy that allows viewing service last accessed information for AWS Organizations. Additionally, it allows read-only access to all of AWS Organizations. This policy defines permissions for programmatic and console access.

        "Action": [
            "iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport",
            "iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport",
            "organizations:Describe*",
            "organizations:List*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
}
```

------

You can also use the [iam:OrganizationsPolicyId](reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.md#ck_OrganizationsPolicyId) condition key to allow generating a report only for a specific AWS Organizations policy. For an example policy, see [IAM: View service last accessed information for an AWS Organizations policy](reference_policies_examples_iam_service-accessed-data-orgs.md).

## Troubleshoot activity for IAM and AWS Organizations entities
<a name="access_policies_last-accessed-troubleshooting"></a>

In some cases, your AWS Management Console last accessed information table might be empty. Or perhaps your AWS CLI or AWS API request returns an empty set of information or a null field. In these cases, review the following issues:
+ For action last accessed information, an action that you are expecting to see might not be returned in the list. This can happen either because the IAM identity does not have permissions for the action, or AWS does not yet track the action for last accessed information.
+ For an IAM user, make sure that the user has at least one inline or managed policy attached, either directly or through group memberships.
+ For an IAM group, verify that the group has at least one inline or managed policy attached.
+ For an IAM group, the report returns only the service last accessed information for members that used the group's policies to access a service. To learn whether a member used other policies, review the last accessed information for that user.
+ For an IAM role, verify that the role has at least one inline or managed policy attached.
+ For an IAM entity (user or role), review other policy types that might affect the permissions of that entity. These include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, or session policies. For more information, see [Policy types](access_policies.md#access_policy-types) or [Policy evaluation for requests within a single account](reference_policies_evaluation-logic_policy-eval-basics.md).
+ For an IAM policy, make sure that the specified managed policy is attached to at least one user, group with members, or role.
+ For an AWS Organizations entity (root, OU, or account), make sure that you are signed using AWS Organizations management account credentials.
+ Verify that [SCPs are enabled in your organization root](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies.html#enable_policies_on_root).
+ Action last accessed information is only available for the actions listed in [IAM action last accessed information services and actions](access_policies_last-accessed-action-last-accessed.md).

When you make changes, wait at least four hours for activity to appear in your IAM console report. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS API, you must generate a new report to view the updated information.

## Where AWS tracks last accessed information
<a name="last-accessed_tracking-period"></a>

AWS collects last accessed information for the standard AWS Regions. When AWS adds additional Regions, those Regions are added to the following table, including the date that AWS started tracking information in each Region.
+ **Service information** – The tracking period for services is at least 400 days, or less if your Region began tracking this feature within the last 400 days.
+ **Actions information** – The tracking period for Amazon S3 management actions began on April, 12, 2020. The tracking period for Amazon EC2, IAM, and Lambda management actions began on April 7, 2021. The tracking period for management actions of all other services began on May 23, 2023. If a Region's tracking date is later than May 23, 2023, then action last accessed information from that Region will start at the later date.

If a Region is not listed in the previous table, then that Region does not yet provide last accessed information.

An AWS Region is a collection of AWS resources in a geographic area. Regions are grouped into partitions. The standard Regions are the Regions that belong to the `aws` partition. For more information about the different partitions, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arns-syntax) in the AWS General Reference. For more information about Regions, see [About AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#region-what-is) also in the AWS General Reference.
