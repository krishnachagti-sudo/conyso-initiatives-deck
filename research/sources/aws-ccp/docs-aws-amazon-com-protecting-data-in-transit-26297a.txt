<a name="protecting-data-in-transit"></a>

 *Data in transit* is any data that is sent from one system to another. This includes communication between resources within your workload as well as communication between other services and your end users. By providing the appropriate level of protection for your data in transit, you protect the confidentiality and integrity of your workload’s data. 

**Secure data from between VPC or on-premises locations:** You can use [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) to create a secure and private network connection between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) or on-premises connectivity to services hosted in AWS. You can access AWS services, third-party services, and services in other AWS accounts as if they were on your private network. With AWS PrivateLink, you can access services across accounts with overlapping IP CIDRs without needing an Internet Gateway or NAT. You also do not have to configure firewall rules, path definitions, or route tables. Traffic stays on the Amazon backbone and doesn’t traverse the internet, therefore your data is protected. You can maintain compliance with industry-specific compliance regulations, such as HIPAA and EU/US Privacy Shield. AWS PrivateLink seamlessly works with third-party solutions to create a simplified global network, allowing you to accelerate your migration to the cloud and take advantage of available AWS services.
